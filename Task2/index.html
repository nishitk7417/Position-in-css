    <!--Relative positioning refers to positioning an element relative to its normal position on the page. When you apply position: relative; to an element, you can then use the properties top, bottom, left, and right to move the element relative to where it would normally be positioned in the document flow. -->
    <!--Absolute positioning refers to positioning an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with a position other than static) or to the initial containing block (usually the <html> element). When you apply position: absolute; to an element, you can use top, bottom, left, and right to position it precisely relative to these ancestors. -->
